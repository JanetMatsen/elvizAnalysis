# The Bdellovibrionaceae are a family of Proteobacteria. They include genera,
# such as Bdellovibrio and Vampirovibrio, which are unusual parasites that
# enter other bacteria.
# The myxobacteria are a group of bacteria that predominantly live in the
# soil and feed on insoluble organic substances. The myxobacteria have very
# large genomes, relative to other bacteria e.g. 9-10 million nucleotides.
